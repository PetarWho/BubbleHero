## Information ℹ️
- This Game was built in **48 hours** during the 2025 **Global Game Jam** in **Plovdiv**.
- The theme for this year was "**_Bubble_**"

## Description 💬
**Bubble Hero** is a First Person Shooter game in which the player shoots bubbles to capture animals and save them from the extreme heatwave coming from behind the player, while also doing parkour to evade obstacles and run away from the heatwave. The game was built on Unreal Engine 5 as we wanted to try something new and we had little to no experience in Unreal Engine.

## Mechanics ⚙️
The game features several core mechanics:
- Player can Double Jump
- Player can Dash
- Player has high speed and if combined with the dash while in air, the momentum is kept, resulting in a **fast paced experience**
- Power ups on the ground
- Fixed number of bubbles that can be shot *(Allowing ammo pickups for future updates)*
- Score increasing with every saved animal

## Installation ⬇️
*The game files can be found on the official Global Game Jam*, **but we suggest cloning or downloading this repository as it contains all the files.** 

> *The maximum file size allowed on the submission page was not enough to include all the assets and may not function properly.*
